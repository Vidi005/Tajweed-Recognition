# This Tajweed Recognition Experiment Project is no Longer Maintained
I'm so sorry for stopping this project for now. I have tried to make this project better but there are still so many bugs for recognizing tajweed rules on any types of Mushaf that can make misunderstanding for distinguishing tajweed laws. It's so difficult for distinguishing many kinds of Tajweed Rules by using regex pattern programmatically and I don't have much time for continuing this project. Therefore this repo may be removed or became private later. If you want to include Tajweed Colorization on your own Quran App, you can use <a href="https://api-docs.quran.com/docs/quran.com_versioned/4.0.0/quran-verses-uthmani-tajweed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quran.com API</a> for alternative solution.
